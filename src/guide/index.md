# Getting started with DesignOps 
In the era of microservices and APIs, a digital product is designed and built by multiple teams, usually organised in domains. The end goal of DesignOps (design operations) is to enable product teams deliver a consistent user experience. But that's just the tip of the iceberg!{.text-lead}

Like we [talked](https://google.com) about in the beginning, ChimeKit is never done. Like any good product or experience, it continues to evolve over time. In just the short time since we built ChimeKit 1.0, we've already evolved to versions 1.1 and 1.2. The biggest changes were our type ramp and colors. Once those were componentized in both Figma and code, it was easy for us to transition from Source Sans to Circular, and from inaccessible colors to accessible ones. All of the mocks changed with just a few taps, and the Chime app changes with just a few new lines of code.

Chimekit alleviates the pains of modern product development by offering a design and development system that takes care of the mundane stuff. By systematizing frontend engineering, and freeing our team to focus on the harder (funner) problems, we can be more productive at building high-quality experiences for Chime members.

## Treat your design system like a design problem
Every Friday, the ChimeKit council (design owners, PM, and dev owners) reviews all the items under “Component Review” to decide if the component is ready to add to the code library. If everything goes well, a ticket (representing a component) will move from left to right on the JIRA board to finally get published in the app.
